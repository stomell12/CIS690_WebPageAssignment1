    <p>Hi! My name is Sam Tomelleri, I'm a senior here at Pitt interested in most all things technology.  Unsurprisingly my hobbies are based around that as well, but moreso for older technology.  I collect and work on vintage computers from the 1970s-1990s along with CRTs; I also spend some time archiving documents and files that are not available anywhere on the interent.</p>
